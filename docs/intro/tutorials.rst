There are three tutorials:

* `CardIO <https://github.com/analysiscenter/cardio/blob/master/tutorials/I.CardIO.ipynb>`_
In this tutorail we briefly introduce some instances of `Dataset <https://github.com/analysiscenter/dataset>`_ and show capabilities of the CardIO's EcgBatch class.

* `Pipelines <https://github.com/analysiscenter/cardio/blob/master/tutorials/II.Pipelines.ipynb>`_
In this tutorial we show how to create pipelines, use them for preprocessing and add your custom action to the EcgBatch with ease.

* `Models <https://github.com/analysiscenter/cardio/blob/master/tutorials/III.Models.ipynb>`_
This tutorial shows how to embed models in pipelines to perform training and prediction.
