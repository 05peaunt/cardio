The following tutorials will help you to explore CardIO framework from simple to complex notions. Tutorials are organized as IPython Notebook, so you can run the code cells and see the result. 

* `CardIO <https://github.com/analysiscenter/cardio/blob/master/tutorials/I.CardIO.ipynb>`_ 
Explains how to create a dataset of ECGs and gives very basic examples how to use dataset.

* `Pipelines <https://github.com/analysiscenter/cardio/blob/master/tutorials/II.Pipelines.ipynb>`_
Here we create a preprocessing workflow from built-in actions and enrich it with a new custom action.

* `Models <https://github.com/analysiscenter/cardio/blob/master/tutorials/III.Models.ipynb>`_
End-to-end model training, including data load and preprocess pipeline.
