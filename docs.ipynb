    "```ecg``` is a library that works with electrocardiogram signal. It allows easily load and process ecg signal and learn any model. The library is based on [Dataset]() and supports its whole functionality. So you can define your oun pipeline, write custon preprocess functions or use built-in ones and handle with datasets even if it does not fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ecg``` has two modules: [```batch```]() and [```models```](). \n",
    "\n",
    "In ```batch``` we gather everything you may need to process ecg signal:\n",
    "* load and save signal in a number of formats\n",
    "* resample, crop or flip signal\n",
    "* filter signal\n",
    "* apply complex transformations like fft or wavelets\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "In ```models``` we provide several models that should inspire you to start you ouw research. Provided models are created to learn the most important problems in ecg:\n",
    "* how to recognize specific features of ecg like R-peaks, P-wave, T-wave\n",
    "* how to recignize dengerous deseases from ecg, for example - atrial fibrillation.\n",
