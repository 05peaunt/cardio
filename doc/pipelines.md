# Pipelines

This module contains pipelines that we used for model training and
predicting. Ypu can use them as-is to train similar models or 
adjust them in order to find better solution.

## How to use

There are 3 simple steps in using pipelines. First, we import desired pipeline, e.g. dirichlet_train
```python
from cardio.pipelines import dirichlet_train
```
Second, we specify its parameters, e.g. path to data:
```python
pipeline = dirichlet_train('path')
```
Third, we pass dataset to pipeline and run caclulation:
```python
(dataset >> pipeline).run(batch_size=100, n_epochs=10)
```
Result is typically a trained model or some values stored in pipeline variable (e.g. model predicitons).
