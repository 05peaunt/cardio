# Batch

This module stores batch class for ECG and various actions on ECG batch.

## ecg_batch

Contains class EcgBatch that defines how to store ECG data and lists actions
that can be applied to ECG in preprocessing stage. 

Attributes of EcgBatch:
* ```signal```, stores ECG signals in numpy array
* ```annotation```, array of dicts with different types of annotations, e.g. array of R-peaks
* ```meta```, array of dicts with metadata about ECG records, e.g. signal frequency
* ```target```, array of labels assigned to ECG records
* ```unique_labels```, array of all possible target labels in dataset.

Actions of EcgBatch allows e.g.:
* load ECG records from wfdb or blosc format
* segment, flip and resample signals
* filter signals 
* allocate PQ, QT, QRS segments
* dump results.

## ecg_batch_tools

Contains general methods for signal processing that are exploited in EcgBatch actions.


## kernels

Contains kernel generation functions for signal convolution.


## utils

Miscellaneous ECG Batch utils.
