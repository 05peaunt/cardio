# FFT inception model

FFT model learns to classify ECG signals using signal spectrum. At first step it convolves signal with a number of 1D kernels.
Then for each channel it applies fast fourier transform. 
The result is considered as 2D image and is processed with a number of [Inception2d]() blocks
to resulting output, which is a predicted class. See below the model architecture:

## How to use
We applied this model to arrhythmia prediction from single-lead ECG. Train pipeline we used for the fft model looks as follows:
```python
fft_train_pipeline = (ds.Pipeline()
                      .load(fmt="wfdb", components=["signal", "meta"])
                      .load(src=".../REFERENCE.csv", fmt="csv", components="target")
                      .drop_labels(["~"])
                      .replace_labels({"N": "NO", "O": "NO"})
                      .random_resample_signals("normal", loc=300, scale=10)
                      .drop_short_signals(4000)
                      .split_signals(3000, 3000)
                      .binarize_labels()
                      .signal_transpose([0, 2, 1])
                      .ravel())
```
